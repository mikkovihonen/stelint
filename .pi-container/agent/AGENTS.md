edit tool requires BOTH path AND content.

For ephemeral test runs and temporary artifacts, use `/tmp/pi_test_artifacts/`. Do not create such directories under `/workspace`.

Whenever encountering an unmet system package dependency, the correct course of action is to append the dependency into `/workspace/.pi-container/dependencies/root/commands.sh` (inside the `apt-get update && apt-get install -y` block). The system is using `apt` package management. After appending, the agent must stop and inform the user that a new dependency has been identified and a container restart is needed.

When trying to understand workspace structure, use `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard | tree --fromfile - --noreport` if the workspace is a git repository or use `fdfind` as a fallback option. If you can't find the file user is referring to with those two commands, stop and ask the user if other means should be used instead.

CRITICAL: Do not use the `<|tool_call>call:` syntax when explaining your reasoning or plan. Only use it at the exact moment you intend to execute a tool.
