ASD-STE100 Section 8 Checks (Punctuation and word count)

Summary of the rules

Punctuation
Rule 8.1: You can use all standard English punctuation marks but not the semicolon (;).
Rule 8.2: Use hyphens (-) to connect words that are directly related.
Rule 8.3: You can use parentheses: To make references to illustrations or text,
          To include letters or numbers that identify items on an illustration or in a text,
          To identify the work steps in a procedure, To include abbreviations,
          To give the singular and plural forms of a noun at the same time,
          To explain words or a part of a sentence, To include an alternative.

Word count
Rule 8.4: In a vertical list, a colon (:) has the same effect on word count as a period and shows the end of a sentence.
Rule 8.5: When you put text in parentheses, it counts as one word in that sentence.
Rule 8.6: Count each of these elements as one word: Numbers, Numbers together with units of measurement,
          Abbreviations, Alphanumeric identifiers, Quoted text, Titles, headings, placards, and labels,
          Proper nouns of individuals, groups, organizations, and geopolitical entities.
Rule 8.7: Hyphenated words count as one word.

    sentences. It is also not easy to use correctly. As an alternative to the
    semicolon, always write two different sentences.
