ASD-STE100 Section 3 Checks (Verbs)

Summary of the rules

Verb forms and tenses of verbs
Rule 3.1: Use only the verb forms that are given in the dictionary.
Rule 3.2: Use only these verb forms and tenses of verbs:
          - The infinitive form
          - The imperative form (command form)
          - The simple present tense
          - The simple past tense
          - The simple future tense
          - The past participle form (as an adjective).
Rule 3.3: Use the past participle form as an adjective.
Rule 3.4: Do not use auxiliary verbs to make complex verb constructions.
Rule 3.5: Use the "-ing" form of a verb only as a technical noun or as a
          modifier in a technical noun.

Active voice
Rule 3.6: Use the active voice. In descriptive writing, you can use the passive
          voice only when the agent is unknown.

How to describe an action
Rule 3.7: Use an approved verb to describe an action, not a noun or other
          parts of speech.
