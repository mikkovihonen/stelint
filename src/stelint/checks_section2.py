ASD-STE100 Section 2 Checks (Multi-word nouns)

Summary of the rules

Multi-word nouns
Rule 2.1: Write multi-word nouns of no more than three words.
Rule 2.2: When a technical noun has more than three words, write it in full.
Then, you can use one of these methods to make the technical noun clear:
- Give a shorter form of the technical noun
- Use hyphens (-) between words that you use as one unit.

This module implements Rule 2.1 (multi-word noun length) and Rule 2.2
(when technical nouns have more than three words).

    Rule 2.1: "Write multi-word nouns of no more than three words."

    Long multi-word nouns are not easy to understand because the words in the
    multi-word noun can connect to each other differently. The main noun, or head
    noun of the group, is usually the last word of the multi-word noun.

    To help your reader, keep multi-word nouns to a maximum of three words.
