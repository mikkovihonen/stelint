ASD-STE100 Section 7 Checks (Safety instructions)

Summary of the rules

Definitions
A warning tells the reader that there is a risk of injury or death.
A caution tells the reader that there is a risk of damage to objects.

How to write safety instructions
Rule 7.1: Use an applicable word (for example, "warning" or "caution") to
          identify the level of risk.
Rule 7.2: Start a safety instruction with a clear and accurate command or
          condition.
Rule 7.3: Give an explanation to show the risk or possible result.
