Different sentence constructions
Rule 9.1: Use a different sentence construction to write a sentence when a word-for-word replacement is not sufficient.

How to use approved words correctly
Rule 9.2: Use each approved word correctly.
Rule 9.3: When you use two words together, do not make phrasal verbs.

Consistent style
Rule 9.4: When you select terminology or wording, always use a consistent style.
