ASD-STE100 General Recommendations Checks (GR-1 through GR-8)

The general recommendations (GR) in this section are not STE rules. They can help you prevent typical errors that writers make.

GR-1: The conjunction "that"
Use the conjunction "that" after verbs like "make sure," "show," and "recommend" to prevent ambiguity.

GR-2: The preposition "with"
The preposition "with" has three approved meanings: "association or relationship," "help or sharing," or "a means or instrument." In some sentences, this word can cause ambiguity.

GR-3: How to use pronouns
Pronouns refer to a person, a location, or an item that is already in a text. Examples of pronouns are "it," "they," "that," "these," and "those." If a pronoun can refer to one or more nouns in a text, it can cause ambiguity in a sentence.

GR-4: The pronoun "this"
When you use the pronoun "this" in a sentence, make sure that the reader knows the item the pronoun refers to. If "this" can refer to more than one item, give the applicable context again.

GR-5: False friends
A false friend is a word or an expression that looks the same as one in a person's native language but that has a different meaning in a different language.

GR-6: Latin abbreviations
STE recommends that you do not use Latin abbreviations because they can confuse your readers if they do not know them. Always use English words to make the text clear.

GR-7: Inclusive language
Inclusive language prevents bias and makes sure that all persons have respect and representation. STE does not include examples of inclusive language, but it fully complies with gender-neutral language requirements. Gender-specific pronouns, for example "he" or "she" are not permitted in STE.

GR-8: Possessive form
The possessive form (also known as the Saxon genitive) adds an apostrophe and "s" to form the possessive. While permitted in STE, use it correctly. If not sure, do not use it.
