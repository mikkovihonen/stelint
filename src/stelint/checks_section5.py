ASD-STE100 Section 5 Checks (Procedural writing)

Summary of the rules

Sentences
Rule 5.1: Write short sentences. Use a maximum of 20 words in each sentence.
Rule 5.2: Write only one instruction in each sentence unless two or more actions occur at the same time.

Verbs in procedures
Rule 5.3: Write instructions in the imperative (command) form.

Descriptive statements in instructions
Rule 5.4: When there is a condition that the reader must know about first, start the instruction with a descriptive statement. Then, divide that descriptive statement from the command with a comma.

Notes
Rule 5.5: Write notes only to give information, not instructions.
